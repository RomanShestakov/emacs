;; Simple Tk script to create a button that prints "Hello, world".
;; Click on the button to terminate the program.
;; 
;; The first line below creates the button, and the second line
;; arranges for packer to manage the button's geometry, centering
;; it in the application's main window.

(require "Tk-classes")

(define b (make <Button> :text "Hello, world" 
			 :command (lambda () 
				    (format #t "Hello, world~%")
				    (destroy *root*))))
(pack b)
